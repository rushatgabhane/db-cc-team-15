### Steps
Download/clone code from https://github.com/JDSSam/arrakis

You need to use Cloud Source Repository. Bydefault you will see an empty repo called arrakis. First thing you will need to do is to create project folder where your team can perform code check-ins.

Regarding api and ui project you can refer readme.md file under both the folders.
